## About Me

I focus on cybersecurity and digital forensics, with research experience in adversarial modeling, privacy-preserving malware detection, and provenance analysis. My work applies artificial intelligence to uncover and explain malicious behaviors, and I aim to extend these methods to AI-driven and IoT forensic investigations, building reliable tools for evidence attribution and secure networked systems.
