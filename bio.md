## About Me

I am a Master's researcher in Cybersecurity at Huazhong University of Science and Technology (HUST), actively pursuing PhD opportunities for Fall 2026. My research is driven by a desire to understand and counter sophisticated cyber threats at a fundamental level.

My master's thesis, "Research on Ransomware Detection Technology Based on CNN-BiLSTM Hybrid Model," involved building an end-to-end system for behavioral malware analysis. I led the creation of a novel dataset of 30,173 ransomware samples by instrumenting and tracing low-level system behaviors (APIs, DLLs, mutexes) and mapping them to the MITRE ATT&CK framework. I then designed and implemented a federated learning-based framework that achieved 99.9% detection accuracy while preserving data privacy, resulting in a first-author publication.

I am now seeking to deepen my work by moving from behavioral *detection* to a more foundational understanding of software *exploitation*. I am particularly interested in program analysis, binary reverse engineering, and automated techniques for vulnerability discovery and hardening.
