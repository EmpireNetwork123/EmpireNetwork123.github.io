## About Me
I am a Master's researcher in Cybersecurity at Huazhong University of Science and Technology (HUST), actively pursuing PhD opportunities for Fall 2026. My research is driven by a desire to understand and counter sophisticated cyber threats at a fundamental level.

My master's thesis, "Research on Ransomware Detection Technology Based on CNN-BiLSTM Hybrid Model," involved building an end-to-end system for behavioral malware analysis. I led the creation of a novel dataset of 30,173 ransomware samples by instrumenting and tracing low-level system behaviors (APIs, DLLs, mutexes) and mapping them to the MITRE ATT&CK framework. I then designed and implemented a federated learning framework that achieved 99.9% detection accuracy while preserving data privacy, resulting in a first-author publication.

At the moment, I am expanding my interests along **explainable AI** in security systems, **interactive data visualization** for threat intelligence, and **human-centered approaches** to vulnerability discovery. My goal is to develop **robust, interpretable systems** that protect critical infrastructure while empowering users through **intuitive interfaces** and **accessible security tools**.
