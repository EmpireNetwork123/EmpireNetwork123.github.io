    <h3>About Me</h3>
<p>
In 2023, I received the fully funded Chinese Government Scholarship for a master's program, graduating with a 91.78 GPA (4.0/4.0) in cybersecurity under the supervision of 
<a href="#" style="font-weight:600; color:#1f6feb; text-decoration:none;">Professor Songfeng Lu</a>. 
Following the program, I was recognised with the 
<span style="font-weight:600; color:#1f6feb;">
Outstanding International Student Award 2025
</span> 
from Huazhong University of Science and Technology.
</p>

<p>
Earlier in my career, I received the 
<span style="font-weight:600; color:#1f6feb;">
Technology Wiz Award 2015
</span> 
from Michael Okpara University of Agriculture, Nigeria, for developing a CGPA calculation application during the Computer Engineering Department Exhibition Week. I have actively participated in conferences, seminars, and talks on artificial intelligence, machine learning, and cybersecurity in Africa, China, and internationally. I have four peer-reviewed publications, two as first author.
</p>

<p>
My master's thesis, "Research on Ransomware Detection Technology Based on CNN-BiLSTM Hybrid Model," involved building an end-to-end system for behavioral malware analysis. I led the creation of a novel dataset of 30,173 ransomware samples by instrumenting and tracing low-level system behaviors (APIs, DLLs, mutexes) and mapping them to the MITRE ATT&CK framework. I then designed and implemented a federated learning based framework that achieved 99% detection accuracy while preserving data privacy.</p>
