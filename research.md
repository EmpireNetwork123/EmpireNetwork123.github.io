My research focuses on building reliable, explainable security systems through human-centered computing and AI-driven methods. I bridge technical security research with practical usability, creating tools that are both powerful and accessible for security analysts.

## Research Themes

**Human-Centered Security & AI Interaction**
I design security tools with the analyst in mind, focusing on explainable AI and intuitive interfaces. My work explores how natural language processing can translate complex threat detections into actionable insights, and how interactive visualization makes security data comprehensible.

**AI/ML Applications in Security**
My core expertise lies in developing machine learning systems for security challenges. I've built federated learning frameworks for ransomware detection that achieve high accuracy while preserving privacy. I'm particularly interested in adaptive systems that learn from analyst feedback to improve over time.

**Natural Language Processing for Security**
I'm exploring how NLP techniques can revolutionize security operations - from automatically generating plain-English explanations of malware behavior to processing security documentation and threat reports at scale.

**Decentralized & Privacy-Preserving Systems**
I have practical experience designing systems that provide strong detection capabilities without centralizing sensitive data. My work in federated learning demonstrates how we can balance security efficacy with privacy constraints.

**Automated Program Analysis**
I develop techniques from fuzzing to behavioral analysis that make complex forensic and vulnerability discovery tasks more systematic and accessible to security professionals.
