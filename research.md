## Research Vision

My research seeks to build reliable, explainable security for complex software systems. I am driven by the challenge of deconstructing malicious software to understand its fundamental mechanics, enabling both precise detection and robust prevention.

### Research Themes

*   **Network Security & Malware Analysis:** My work begins with understanding adversary behavior. I have developed systems for high-accuracy ransomware detection by analyzing low-level program execution. I aim to extend this into generalized binary analysis and reverse engineering to combat evolving threats.
*   **Decentralized Privacy-Preserving :** I have practical experience with Federated Learning, designing systems that provide strong detection capabilities without centralizing sensitive data. I am interested in further exploring systems that balance security efficacy with privacy constraints.
*   **Automated Program Analysis & Forensics:** I am fascinated by the potential of automated techniques—from fuzzing to symbolic execution—to discover vulnerabilities and reconstruct attack narratives. My goal is to contribute to tools that make complex forensic and analysis tasks more systematic and accessible.
